<h1>Node.js Exclusive Chat Rooms</h2>

<p>This application was made to learn how does websocket & redis works</p>
Feel free to use it as your own.
Just one information, before you will git clone it :)
I ran out of time, when I was doing this application and I had to start another one, so I stopped this project.
Maybe I will find some time in future to make it 100% functional, but for now:
If you want to have working multi-rooms, you need to add it.
Models and controllers for that are done, so just easy to do implementation with websockets.


What do you need to run this app:<br/>
1) Redis server<br/>
2) Node.js of course<br/><br/>

--Run redis server on your local machine.<br/>
--Run "npm install" from inside of the project.<br/>
--Run "bower install" from inside of the project.<br/>
--Run "node server.js"<br/>
--Go to localhost:3000, and enjoy.
